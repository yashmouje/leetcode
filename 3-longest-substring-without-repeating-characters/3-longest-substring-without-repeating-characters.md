### Example 2:

> Input: s = "bbbbb"\
> Output: 1\
> Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

### Example 3:

> Input: s = "pwwkew"\
> Output: 3\
> Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. \
> Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Constraints
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.`
